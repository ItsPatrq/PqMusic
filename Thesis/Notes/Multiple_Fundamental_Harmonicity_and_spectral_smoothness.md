1. A sound has a certain pitch if it can be reliably matched by adjusting the frequency of a sine wave of arbitrary ampli- tude [5]. Pitch is a perceptual attribute of sounds. The corre- sponding physical term F0 is defined for periodic or nearly pe- riodic sounds only. For these classes of sounds, F0 is closely related to pitch and is defined as the inverse of the period, i.e., the time shift for which the time-domain signal shows high cor- relation with itself. In cases where the fundamental period is ambigous, a candidate closest to the subjective pitch period is regarded as the correct F0.
